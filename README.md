# Gandeloaf's UO Outlands Arcane Autobot

## Summary
As of May 2024 Arcane became a viable new Magery build in UO Outlands, one that doesn't require summoning to be viable. As there aren't other scripts available for Arcane mages freely available I've taken it upon myself to fill the gap.

There is no summoning functionality as that isn't compatible with an Arcane mage build.
I've tried to account for most major buffs and spells.
Cooldowns triggered by the script are available to add to your profile as listed in the cooldowns.xml.
The script deals with multiple types of poison but I'll continue to improved this functionality.
Arcane abilities like leyline are now usable by the script, as I unlock the additional abilities on my character I'll expand the capabilities of the code.

## My current build this works well with:

### Skills
* Arcane 100
* Evaluating Intelligence 100
* Focus 100
* Magery 100
* Meditation 100
* Wrestling 100
* Inscription 120

### Arcane Codex:
* Leech 5

### Wizard's Grimoire:
* Create Food 3
* Magic Arrow 2
* Harm 1
* Protection 1
* Fireball 1
* Bless 1
* Lightning 1
* Greater Heal 1
* Curse 1
* Mana Drain 1
* Mind Blast 2
* Magic Reflect 2
* Flamestrike 1

### Credits:
The original bones of this are based on work done by SINGsingFan for his Lazy Mage script, it has been heavily modified since but I'd like to acknowledge their work.
