# Gandeloaf's UO Outlands Arcane Autobot

## Summary
As of May 2024 Arcane became a viable new Magery build, one that doesn't require summoning to be viable. I wrote this script as there weren't any other free publicly accessible arcane bot scripts.
Script initially built upon work done by SINGsingFan afor his Lazy Mage script.
All summoning functionality has been removed, extra buffs and spells added, cooldowns added, mana management reworked, capability to deal with being poisoned added, and now uses Arcane abilities like leyline.
